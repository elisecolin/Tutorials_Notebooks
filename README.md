# Remote Sensing Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of interactive and educational Python notebooks designed for teaching and demonstrating key concepts in remote sensing, with a focus on image registration, signal processing, speckle...

The notebooks are designed for execution in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and include reproducible examples based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data from [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/).

## ðŸ“˜ Notebooks

- `Sentinel_2_Cube.ipynb`:  
  Demonstrates how to extract a Sentinel-2 time series using Earth Engine, perform subpixel image registration using phase correlation in the Fourier domain, and visualize geometric misalignments and corrections.

- `Generation_Video_Speckle_Funny.ipynb`:  
  Simulates a dynamic speckle sequence based on a synthetic binary text mask, where speckle decorrelation is spatially modulated. The notebook demonstrates how to extract an activity map based on decorrelation rate.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

You can open each notebook directly in Colab using the badge links below each file, or clone the repository locally.
